where does the dataset originate from:

from 1996
Donor: Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker,
        Data Mining and Visualization
        Silicon Graphics.
        e-mail: ronnyk@sgi.com for questions.

for what purpose it was collected and by whom (copy paste from source is ok, but cite url or bibtex):

 First cited in "Scaling up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid":
    author={Ron Kohavi},
    booktitle={Proceedings of the Second International Conference on
               Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},
    year = 1996,

 Cant seem to find why it was collected other than the Census bureau decided to do so. In the article they
 use it for predicting whether someone makes more or less than 50K$
