Where does the dataset originate from: 

The data originates from Häußler (1979, 1981) and Fahrmeir and Hamerle (1981, 1984) and is sampled from 
	1973-1975 and comes from a large regional bank in Southern Germany. This is a updated version
	from Grömping, U. (2019) and more can be read on it from the statistics and the background here:

For what purpose it was collected and by whom (copy paste from source is ok, but cite url or bibtex):
It was donated to the UCI from prof. Hans Hoffmann from Hamburg university in 1994. Can be accessed:

Interesting observations which led to the updated version:
for example,creditability of a debtor would become worse when changing the 
credit history variable to “no credits
taken/all credits paid back duly” and better for changing the status variable to “no checking account” (as
opposed to, e.g., an account at the credit-giving bank with a good balance). Further inspection showed
that there are more implausibilities, e.g. that more than 90% of the debtors are supposed to be foreign
workers, and that the data set apparently does not contain any single females.
